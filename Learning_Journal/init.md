## First journal entry for project Euler

This is the first entry into a journal I'm developing to compile project euler learnings. The first step in this process is to learn how to use markdown in VScode!
To that end, I've been researching how to use markdown. I'm a bit familiar with the headers that can be used (see above), but I"m unsure about how to actually visualize what I"m working on (what does the final markdown look like?). I can see the final product in github, but I guess I'll need to search further or ask a friend.


As an experiment, here is a picture that I hope shows up in github of a recent project euler problem that I was solving with friend:
